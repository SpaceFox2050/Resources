# Introduction (Unfinished)

There are three cars shuffler algorithms I made for my grade 9 science project on "What is the most efficient way to sufficiently shuffle a deck of cards from 
factory state?"

The three shuffling techniques included are riffle, a modified version of the overhand, and the smoosh (messpile) shuffle.

# Smooth (messpile) Shuffle

The smoosh (messpile) algorithm works by spreading the deck of cards out on a surface and moving it around. After you think it is enough, the deck of cards is 
combined back into a deck.
